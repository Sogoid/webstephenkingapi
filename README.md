# Stephen King Collection Academic Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a React application that consumes the [Stephen King API](https://stephen-king-api.onrender.com/), allowing users to view a list of books written by Stephen King and access details about each of them. The application will have a simple and intuitive interface, with features to list books and display detailed information when clicking on a title.


## Features
**Book Listing:** The application will make a request to the API to obtain a list of available books. The data will be displayed in a list, showing the title of each book.

**Book Details:** When clicking on a book title, the user will be redirected to a details page, where additional information such as synopsis, year of publication and genre will be displayed.

## Technologies Used

**React/React Native:** For building the user interface.
**Axios:** To make HTTP requests to the API.
**React Router:** For navigation between the book list and the details page.
**CSS/TAILWINDCSS:** For application styling.
